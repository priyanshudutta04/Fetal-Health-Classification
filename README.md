## About

Fetal health monitoring is crucial for ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. It helps in the early detection of potential complications, such as fetal distress or growth abnormalities, allowing for timely medical intervention. Effective monitoring can significantly reduce the risk of adverse outcomes and contribute to a healthy pregnancy and safe delivery.

<br>
A Cardiotocography (CTG) test is a prenatal monitoring technique used to assess fetal well-being by measuring the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions. This model classifies the outcome of Cardiotocogram test to ensure the well being of the fetus.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is available in the `data` directory. It is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.

This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:


- Normal
- Suspect
- Pathological
